To use:
- move this folder to desired location.
- add the following lines to .bashrc file
export LOGPATH="/path/to/log/folder/"
source {$LOGPATH}log.sh
- then add the following line to .vimrc file
set backupcopy=yes
- this file is not normally created by default.
  you may have to create it to set user settings
  in this way.
- without this step, vim may overwrite your logs
 - this is because by default vim usually 
   overwrites your old file with a new file, and
   because the logs are stored as "extended file
   attributes" the logs are lost
 - care should be taken with other text editors
   as this problem could also occur with those
- if you fail to do this, there is a log kept of
  every log every committed stored in $LOGPATH
